Summary:

- The summary has good quality, but it is only 437 words. The requirement was 500!

- The summary has poor quality. 13% of what you wrote comes exactly from an
  article, and that is not good. You can see your report on iLearn/Turnitin.


\LaTeX:

- When writing \LaTeX, try to keep every line of text within 80 characters or
  100 at the most, then continue in a new line, \LaTeX will continue if you
  break lines.

- The usage of figures is incomplete. Usually figures have a caption that
  describes the content of the figure. What you are doing is simply add a
  picture with \includegraphics, but you needed to add a figure.
